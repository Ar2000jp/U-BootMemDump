U-BootMemDump is a small program that makes a copy of a memory area
    through the U-Boot shell.
It's useful for dumping images of small memory chips of a platform, where the
    installed U-Boot bootloader doesn't have any way of saving or sending
    a memory area to disk or over network.

Please note that this program doesn't implement enough reliability measures
    to ensure a correct memory dump. All images must be verified through other
    means. Like, re-downloading the dump file to RAM and doing a memory compare,
    for example.
